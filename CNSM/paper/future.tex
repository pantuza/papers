\section{Future work}
\label{sec:future}

As a future work we plan to build an on-line graph visualizer 
that interacts with the network administrator and shows, in 
an easier way, the entire network operation.
Just like POX, if the controller process is terminated, then the
entire graph is lost.
For that, a distributed graph database can be used to store
the network graph in a persistent, reliable and fault tolerant
structure.
Default graph algorithms should be given by the graph module. 
These algorithms could be configured to run in predefined 
period.
