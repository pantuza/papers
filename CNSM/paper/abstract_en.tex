Software Defined Networks (SDN) is an emergent architecture
that is dynamic, flexible, manageable, low cost, 
consistent with the dynamics of the modern applications.
This paper shows a network 
representation model using a graph as the control plane 
of an SDN controller.
The graph approach provides a globally consistent view of the network
in real time.
Our experiments show that graphs are a reliable representation of 
the real network, simplifying management in Software Defined Networking.
