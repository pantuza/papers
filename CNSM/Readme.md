### Title

> #### Network Management through Graphs in Software Defined Networks


### abstract

    Software Defined Networks (SDN) is an emergent architecture
    that is dynamic, flexible, manageable, low cost, 
    consistent with the dynamics of the modern applications.
    This paper shows a network representation model using a graph as the control plane 
    of an SDN controller.
    The graph approach provides a globally consistent view of the network
    in real time.
    Our experiments show that graphs are a reliable representation of 
    the real network, simplifying management in Software Defined Networking.
